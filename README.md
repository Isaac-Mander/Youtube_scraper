# Youtube_scraper

This is a python program that downloads youtube videos onto your computer.

It requires a youtube api key (set on up here https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)

The program requires the following python libraries:
1. bs4
2. urllib
3. json
4. pytube
5. os
So download them as needed via pip


Set the variables in options.py to the corasponding values, then run the relivant program (I intend to set up more for different situations)
